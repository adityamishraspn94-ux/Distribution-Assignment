        "* When we generate 100 random values using the formula `=RAND()` and plot a histogram, the distribution looks **uniform**.\n",

        "###**Answer:**\n",
        "Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the **shape of a distribution’s tails**—that is, how **heavy or light** the tails are compared to a normal distribution. It tells us whether the data have more outliers or fewer outliers.\n",

        "To calculate the probability of getting **at least 8 successes** in 15 trials when **p = 0.5**, use the **BINOM.DIST** or **BINOM.DIST.RANGE** function.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "###**Answer:**\n",
        "A **log transformation** is often used in data analysis to handle skewed data and reduce the impact of large values.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**How it helps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stabilizes Variance:**\n",
        "   In many datasets, larger values have higher variability.\n",
        "   Taking the log compresses these large values, reducing their spread and making the variance more stable across the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reduces Right Skewness:**\n",
        "   Data that are heavily right-skewed (with a long tail of large values) become more balanced after log transformation.\n",
        "   This helps the data look more **symmetrical** and closer to a **normal distribution**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handles Outliers Better:**\n",
        "   Extreme high values become less extreme after taking logs, making the dataset easier to analyze.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary:**\n",
        "Log transformation **compresses large values, reduces skewness, stabilizes variance**, and often makes the data **more normally distributed**, which is useful for statistical modeling and machine learning.\n",
